# League of Legends World Championships Prediction Project

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for a research project focused on predicting the outcome of the League of Legends World Championships using data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization techniques.

## Project Goals
The primary goals of this project are as follows:
- Collect and preprocess data from the Riot API related to the League of Legends World Championships.
- Develop machine learning models to predict the potential outcome of the next World Championship.
- Compare and evaluate different prediction algorithms using Weka.
- Create a web application to showcase analysis results and visualizations.

## Project Structure
- `data_collection`: Python scripts for retrieving data from the Riot API and storing it in a PostgreSQL database.
- `data_preprocessing`: Code for cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering on the collected data.
- `data_analysis`: Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts for exploratory data analysis and model building using Python and PySpark.
- `weka_testing`: Exported data and scripts for testing machine learning algorithms using Weka.
- `web_application`: Code for the web application to visualize analysis results and predictions.

## Setup
1. Obtain Riot API access and keys. Insert your API keys in the appropriate places in the code.
2. Set up a PostgreSQL database and update database connection details in the scripts.
3. Install required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Set up the web application environment by following the instructions in the `web_application` directory.

## Usage
- Follow the project structure to navigate to different directories for data collection, preprocessing, analysis, Weka testing, and web application development.
- Execute the scripts and notebooks in each directory to perform the corresponding tasks.
- Refer to individual README files in each directory for more detailed instructions.

## Results
- Summary of key findings, insights, and analysis results will be presented in the project report (`project_report.pdf`).
- Visualizations and predictions can be interactively explored on the web application.

## Conclusion
This project aims to leverage data science techniques to predict the outcome of the League of Legends World Championships. Through data analysis, machine learning, and visualization, we hope to gain valuable insights into the factors that contribute to tournament success.
